Classifier. The problem will take you through some of the steps needed to be done, including the preprocessing.\n","\n","\n","The at a high level, the idea of this model goes as follows.\n","- We are given a training set $\\{(x^{(i)}, y^{(i)})\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ where each $x^{(i)}$ is a sentence and $y^{(i)}$ is a class label.\n","- First, we need to loop over $\\{x^{(i)}\\}_{i=1}^{N}$ and get the Vocabulary, the number of unique words we see.\n","- Once we do this, we will express each word as a one-hot representation. To do this, we will use a mapping from a unique word to an integer. For example, \"the\" might get index 3 and if there are 10 words (in the entire Vocabulary) then \"the\" would have a vector representation $x_{the} = (0,0,1,0,0,0,0,0,0,0)$. There will be many words in this Vocabulary, over 13,000. For this example, each word is mapped to a unique integer.\n","- We will feed batches of data to the model and each batch will be transformed into a tensor with words each word transformed to its integer index in VOCAB below.\n","- For example, we might get [[\"the man walks\"], [\"this is a sentence\"]] -> [[\"the\", \"man\", \"walks\"], [\"this\", \"is\", \"a\", \"sentence\"]] -> [[1, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 15]]. It depends on what unique integer each word gets.\n","- Different sentences have different numbers of tokens but all batches need to be the same dimension (this is how PyTorch works), so we need a padding token. So, for example, if the batch size is B = 2 and we given two sentences like [\"a b c\", \"a b c d e\"] then as a tensor this will become [[1, 2, 3, 0, 0], [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]] and notice that we padded the first example so that the tensor is of dimension (2, 5) with M = 5. In some sense, in each batch we need to figure out the maximum number of tokens for an instance and pad each instance to have the same length as this longest instance. To do the above, use the [collate function](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65279115/how-to-use-collate-fn-with-dataloaders). The idea here is that the Dataloader takes in raw data and the collate function is applied to this data, returning formatting tensors we can use later on in the optimization.\n","- After padding, we feed batches of data to the classifier, these are of dimension (B, M). For example, we have a batch size of 2 above and M = 5. This will depend on the batch but here the batch size is B.\n","- Once we feed in (B, M) data to the network, we rewrite this as (B, M, vocab_size) by using a one-hot representation for each word.\n","- Then, we do as it hints in the model's forward method. We first take an average agross all the M elements of each element of the batch to get a (B, vocab_size) tensor that represents each instance. We pass this tensor through linear layer and nonlinear layers as unusual. The model returns logits, without the Softmax applied. This is a multiclass classfication task.\n","\n","Finally, we optimize the network and check it's train and validation set accuracies.
